# MPC

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to implement a Model Predictive Controller(MPC) to optimize a vehicle's trajectory along the track of Udacity's simulator.

The simulator will transmit the following pieces of information to the MPC via a websocket connection:

1. x and y coordinates for waypoints
2. vehicle's global position 
3. vehicle's orientation 
4. steering angle
5. throttle position
6. vehicle's speed 

From this information, the MPC model will send back information to the simulator to draw a yellow line to represent the waypoints and a green line to represent the best polynominal fit for the reference trajectory.

## The Model
The steps for the model are:

1. The model receives information about the vehicle's state and the global coordinates of the waypoints.
2. The global coordinates of the waypoints are converted to the coordinates relative to that of the vehicle.
3. Polynomial coefficents for a line based on the relative waypoints is generated.  This will be represented as a yellow line in the simulator.
4. Predict the current state of the vehicle based on delta t.
5. Using the current state of the vehicle and the coefficents of the line for the relative waypoints, MPC will calculate (solve) the new steering angle and throttle values and generate the line for the reference trajectory.  The IPOPT optimization solver was used to for this.  The reference trajectory will be represented as a green line in the simulator.
6. Send the new steering angle and throttle value and the coordinates of the line for the waypoints and the reference trajectory.

## Settings
Based on trial and error, I chose the following settings:
```
N = 10    // time step length
DT = 0.1  // delta t

// cost coefficents for FG_eval 
cost_cte_factor_ = 3000
cost_epsi_factor_ = 600 
cost_v_factor_ = 1
cost_current_delta_factor_ = 1
cost_diff_delta_factor_ = 200
cost_current_a_factor_ = 1
cost_diff_a_factor_ = 1    

ref_cte_ = 0    // reference cte (crosstrack error)
ref_epsi_ = 0   // refenence epsi (orientation error)
ref_v_ = 40     // reference velocity (mph)
```

The models uses N = 10 time steps in the future which each time step at dt = 0.1 seconds to calculate the state of the vehicle.  First, I tried using different values N for 500 steps in the simulator. While looking at the mean cte and mean epsi, going past N = 10 didn't seem to improve the accuracy. Using a time step of dt = 0.05, the vehicle quickly lost control and flew off the track.  At dt = 0.2, the vehicle moved sluggishly along the track.  The vehicle also had a worse mean cte and mean epsi compared to that of dt = 0.1

## Latency
The simulator has a systemic latency of 100 milliseconds.  To deal with latency, the model will predict the vehicle's new position for dt = 0.1 seconds.  This is handled with the PredictState() function in lines 103-123 of main.cpp. If PredictState() wasn't applied, the model would be using an old state to calculate the new steering angle and throttle values.

## Summary
With a reference velocity of 40 mph, the vehicle runs pretty smoothly usually staying around the mid 30's.  Along curves in the road, the vehicle slowed down but kept to the center of the road.
